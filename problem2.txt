#Flutter uses Dart because:
1. Dart makes it easy for developers to read and visualize it very quickly and effortlessly.
2.Dart,if required,uses the Just In Time(JIT) compilation which reduces time of development.
3.Dart makes use of Ahead Of Time(AOT); AOT compiles flutter dart code smoothly into native.
4.In Dart, there is not not needed any seperate layout language like JSX or XML.
5.Dart supports asynchronous prograaming.
